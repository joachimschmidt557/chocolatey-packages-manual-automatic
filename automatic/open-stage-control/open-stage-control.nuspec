This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements
-->

<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

# Open Stage Control

*Libre and modular OSC / MIDI controller*

Open Stage Control is a desktop OSC bi-directionnal control surface application. It's built on web technologies and run as an [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) web server that accepts any number of clients.

![](http://osc.ammd.net/img/ardour-osc.png)

## Supported platforms

The server can run on all [platforms supported by Electron](https://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/supported-platforms/). Clients just need to connect to the server with a compatible browser :

- any system running Chrome/Chromium version `50` or later (Linux, MacOS, Windows, Android, etc)
- iOS version `9.3` or later

Firefox is *not* supported.

## Virus Scan False Positives

Some anti-virus software falsely flag `osc-midi-windows.exe` as potential malware. This is because this executable was created using [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) and executables created with this tool are known to often get false positive detections [1](https://openstagecontrol.discourse.group/t/windows-deffender-flagged-osc-midi-windows-exe-as-trojan-horse/1437/3) [2](https://openstagecontrol.discourse.group/t/testing-needed-out-of-the-box-midi-support/808/29).
