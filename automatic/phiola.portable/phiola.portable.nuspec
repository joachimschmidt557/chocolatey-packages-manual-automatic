<!-- Read this before creating packages: https://chocolatey.org/docs/create-packages -->
<!-- It is especially important to read the above link to understand additional requirements when publishing packages to the community feed aka dot org (https://chocolatey.org/packages). -->

<!-- Test your packages in a test environment: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-test-environment -->

<!--
This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements
-->

<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

    <!-- This section is about this package, although id and version have ties back to the software -->
    <!-- id is lowercase and if you want a good separator for words, use '-', not '.'. Dots are only acceptable as suffixes for certain types of packages, e.g. .install, .portable, .extension, .template -->
    <!-- If the software is cross-platform, attempt to use the same id as the debian/rpm package(s) if possible. -->

    <!-- version should MATCH as closely as possible with the underlying software -->
    <!-- Is the version a prerelease of a version? https://docs.nuget.org/create/versioning#creating-prerelease-packages -->
    <!-- Note that unstable versions like 0.0.1 can be considered a released version, but it's possible that one can release a 0.0.1-beta before you release a 0.0.1 version. If the version number is final, that is considered a released version and not a prerelease. -->

    <description>
phiola - fast audio player, recorder, converter for Windows, Linux, and Android. It can play audio files from your device or remote server, record audio from your microphone or Internet radio stream, process and convert audio into another format, and more. Its low CPU consumption conserves the notebook/phone battery. You can issue commands to phiola via its CLI, TUI, GUI, system pipe and SDK interfaces. Its fast startup time allows using it from custom scripts on a "play-and-exit" or "record-and-exit" basis. It's completely portable (all codecs are bundled) - you can run it directly from a read-only flash drive. It's a free and open-source project, and you can use it as a standalone application or as a library for your own software.

## Features

* Play audio: `.mp3`, `.ogg`(Vorbis/Opus), `.mp4`/`.mov`(AAC/ALAC/MP3), `.mkv`/`.webm`(AAC/ALAC/MP3/Vorbis/Opus/PCM), `.caf`(AAC/ALAC/PCM), `.avi`(AAC/MP3/PCM), `.ts`(AAC/MP3), `.aac`, `.mpc`; `.flac`, `.ape`, `.wv`, `.wav`.
* Record audio: `.m4a`(AAC), `.ogg`(Vorbis), `.opus`; `.flac`, `.wav`
* Convert audio
* List/search file meta tags; edit file tags, write ReplayGain tags (`.mp3`, `.ogg/.opus`, `.flac`)
* List available audio devices
* Input: file, directory, ICY/HLS/HTTP/HTTPS URL, console (stdin), playlists: `.m3u`, `.pls`, `.cue`
* Command Line Interface for Desktop OS
* Terminal/Console UI for interaction at runtime
* GUI for Windows, Linux, Android
* Instant startup time: very short initial delay until the audio starts playing (e.g. Linux/PulseAudio: TUI: `~25ms`, GUI: `~50ms`)
* Fast (small footprint, low overhead): keeps your CPU, memory and disk I/O at absolute minimum; spends 99% of time inside codec algorithms
