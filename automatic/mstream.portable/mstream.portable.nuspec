This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces 
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements 
-->

<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->

## Philosophy
mStream aims to be the simplest music streaming software around. mStream software will always be free and never have any advertisements

## Naming Scheme
mStream is the name of the entire project. Each piece of software is given name like 'mStream Something'
mStream Server is the backbone behind the entire project. It's a music streaming server written with NodeJS. The code is available on github and you can use it to setup your own server, but it's going to take some work and it has a few dependencies.
mStream Express is a special version of the server the comes with all the dependencies pre-packaged. It also comes with a GUI config tool to makes setup as simple as possible. These modifications allow mStream Express to be run without installing anything.

## History
Development of mStream was started around 2012. I had grown up using Winamp and at this point it was clear that it was time to move to something else. There was old PC collecting dust in my closet so I put Ubuntu on it, moved all my music to it, and started writing scripts to organize my collection's metadata. After a few weeks I had my own, primitive, music streaming service.
mStream Server was worked on as a hobby project for the next few years. During that time I experimented with different server software and rewrote the whole thing from scratch at least twice. Finally I settled on using NodeJS and started work on the latest version of mStream Server. I put this code on Github and one day someone posted a bug about the code crashing on Windows. At this point I had only run it on Linux. It took me a day to get it to install it on Windows, and another half a day to cleanup some Windows exclusive bugs. I still don't recommend installing mStream Server on Windows, it hasn't gotten much easier since then.
That whole Windows ordeal got me curious how other server software handled working on windows. The short answer is: not well. Every server I tried took a lot of time and technical knowledge to get up and running on Windows. So I came up with a challenge, to make a version of mStream Server that could be setup on Windows in under 5 minutes.
mStream Express is the product of this self-imposed challenge. It's so simple that you can get a server up and running in under a minute.
