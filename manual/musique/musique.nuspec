<!-- Read this before creating packages: https://chocolatey.org/docs/create-packages -->
<!-- It is especially important to read the above link to understand additional requirements when publishing packages to the community feed aka dot org (https://chocolatey.org/packages). -->

<!-- Test your packages in a test environment: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-test-environment -->

<!--
This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces 
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements 
-->

<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

    <!-- This section is about this package, although id and version have ties back to the software -->
    <!-- id is lowercase and if you want a good separator for words, use '-', not '.'. Dots are only acceptable as suffixes for certain types of packages, e.g. .install, .portable, .extension, .template -->
    <!-- If the software is cross-platform, attempt to use the same id as the debian/rpm package(s) if possible. -->

    <!-- version should MATCH as closely as possible with the underlying software -->
    <!-- Is the version a prerelease of a version? https://docs.nuget.org/create/versioning#creating-prerelease-packages -->
    <!-- Note that unstable versions like 0.0.1 can be considered a released version, but it's possible that one can release a 0.0.1-beta before you release a 0.0.1 version. If the version number is final, that is considered a released version and not a prerelease. -->

    <summary>Musique unclutters your music listening experience with a clean and innovative interface.</summary>
    <description>
Musique does its best to stay out of the way and keep you focused on the
only thing that really matters: Music.

Musique is great for kids and other family members that may find other
players too complex and cumbersome.
     
* Starts fast, very lightweight and can easily handle large collections.
* Browse by artist photos, album covers and folders too, so you can organize your music your way.
* Immersive Info View you can switch to while listening. It shows information about the current track, album and artist.
* Supports most audio formats, including: FLAC, OGG Vorbis, Monkey's Audio (APE), Musepack (MPC), WavPack (WV), True Audio (TTA)
* Automatically fixes misspellings and case in track titles, album titles and artist names, freeing you from the hassle of manually tagging your files.
* Musique never ever modifies your files, it stores all of its data in its own database.
* Supports scrobbling to Last.fm
* Not an iTunes addon. It's a completely independent application that does one thing and does it well.
* Translated to more than 20 languages including German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Russian and Chinese.
